# Business Story – 60-Day Finance, Sales & Operations Analytics Platform

## 1. Company Background
- Company: GlobalTech Appliances (fictional)
- Industry: Home appliances manufacturing with international distribution
- Key Markets: Europe and Asia
- Sales Channels: Distributors + Direct-to-consumer (online)
- Annual Revenue: €150M
- Current Challenges:
  - Management only sees monthly financial statements and lacks visibility into profitability by region, product line, or customer segment.
  - The sales team focuses on top-line revenue but has limited awareness of discount impact and customer profitability.
  - Operations holds large inventory volumes yet struggles to identify slow-moving or obsolete stock.

## 2. Project Goal
Build a complete data platform and Power BI reporting system within 60 days to answer the company’s three most important questions:

1. **Where is the company truly making money, and where is it losing money?** (Finance)
2. **Which customers, products, and regions deserve more investment?** (Sales)
3. **Is inventory helping growth or locking up unnecessary cash?** (Operations)

The final deliverable will be a unified Finance–Sales–Operations analytics dashboard backed by automated pipelines and a clean dimensional model.

## 3. Key Business Questions by Role

### CEO
- Why is the overall profitability not improving?
- Which business units (regions/products) are profit drivers vs. loss makers?
- Is cash flow strong enough to support the next 6–12 months of plans?

### CFO
- How does Operating Margin compare to budget this month/quarter?
- Is revenue growth genuine, or driven by discounts and one-off deals?
- How much cash is tied up in receivables and inventory? Is turnover worsening?

### Sales Director
- Which customers contribute 80% of revenue or margin?
- Are high discounts destroying margin?
- What is the Sales Target Achievement rate by region, team, and product?

### Operations Director
- Is the inventory structure healthy by age, product, and warehouse?
- How is production capacity utilized? Any bottlenecks or idle resources?
- What is the On-time In-full (OTIF) delivery rate? Which regions/products are causing delays?
